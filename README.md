# FunArrayQueue

### Interactive App Using Array Queues
s
FunArrayQueue was developed in c language to demonstrate how to use an queue using an array data structure. Queue arrays don't have to be wasteful! When a queue fills up an array, but there's room at the start of the array from dequeuing -implement a circular queue. My mother always said waste not want not, thus this array moves the front and rear of the line circularly as indicies are freed up.

- Create your own fun fun queue
- Queue! Dequeue! Display! It's madness!
- Swanky mod algorithm to utilize all the array's resources circularly.
